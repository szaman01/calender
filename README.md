# calender
The Master Schedule System is a calendar application which aids the user in making appointments, and sorting it depending on the date and time.
First the program asks the user how many appointments they would like to make. Then, the program loops the scanning of the users input for the name of the appointment, date and time that many times before it ends the loop.
Next, the program prints the userâ€™s responses in an ordered fashion. The earliest date and time is printed out first. This is going to be done by using bubble sort. 
After it is sorted, the sorted array is written in the text file.

Methods that will be used:
Java input/output will be used by reading/writing text files.
Array/ArrayLists will be used.
Use of Bubble Sort.
Calling methods from different classes.
